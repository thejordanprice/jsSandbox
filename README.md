### Why

1. I think its a pretty fun idea to send are individual functions that eval to help eachother all learn.
2. I needed a project to work on that wasn't completely boring (something that might grow, cough).
3. I love coding and teaching people how to code, I think this is the perfect platform for doing so.

### To-Do

- [ ] Saving the functions.
- [ ] Loading the functions.
- [ ] Cloud function integration with db.
- [ ] Code syntax highlighting.
